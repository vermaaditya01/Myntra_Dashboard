### 2) Objective 🎯
To develop an interactive Performance Dashboard to study & analyse Myntra's sales & services quality in different parts of India enabling data-driven business decisions.

### 3) Tech Stack 🛠️
The project leveraged following tools & technologies:
  - 🧹 **Power Query Editor:** Data cleaning & transformation.
  - 🟩 **MS Excel:** Storing the data, Dashboard development.

### 4) Data Source 🔗
**Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhigaykwad/myntra-analysis-dataset

  - The dataset organised into three tables **Products**, **Customers** & **Orders** provides insights into Myntra’s sales activity, consisting of **3,500** orders placed by **100** customers across **3,071** unique products. It captures essential details on purchases, buyer profiles & product attributes.

### 5) Business Problem❗
Myntra wants to enhance customer retention and maximize sales revenue by understanding purchasing behavior across its wide product catalog. Despite having data on Products, Customers & Orders there's limited visibility into:
  - Which products or categories drive the most revenue.
  - Seasonal or trend-based variations in demand.
  - Opportunities to cross-sell or upsell to existing customers.
  - Customer Satisfaction level.
  - Regional Demographics.
Without these insights, Myntra risks losing customers to competitors and missing growth opportunities in a highly competitive fashion e-commerce market.

### 6) Key Features & Visuals ✨
   - **KPI Cards (Total Sales, Total Orders, Average Rating, Average Discount):** Shows quick performance summary.

   - **Slicers:** Allows filtering by Year, Month, Sub-category, Color, Brand Name, Age for interactive exploration.

   - **Line Chart (Quarterly Sales Trend):** Tracks sales growth and fluctuations across quarters to identify demand patterns.

   - **Funnel Chart (Customers by Rating):** Displays customer satisfaction levels across 2–5 star ratings.

   - **Bar Chart (State-wise Customer Count):** Highlights top states by customer volume, showing regional distribution.

### 7) Challenges Faced 🚧
During the course of this project, several technical and data-related challenges were encountered and strategically addressed to ensure accuracy and reliability of the analysis:-

**a) Data Cleaning Issues** 
  - The dataset contained some inconsistencies like incorrect values & spellings in fields like subcategory, Color columns in Products table. They were handled by replacement startegies.
  
  - Ensured data consistency & quality by renaming columns,  trimming columns fields, rounding off numerical columns & adding calculated columns like Selling Price

**b) Data Structure Complications** 
  - While working on MS Excel it was crucial to merge different tables into a single consistent data table for correct insights & metrics calculations. This was tackled with the help of Lookup functions such as XLOOKUP.

**c) Visual Calculation problems** 
  - Encountered difficulties in sorting values by customer count while creating a bar chart to display state-wise customer distribution. This was resolved by generating a helper table using the GETPIVOTDATA function to extract values from the Pivot Table.
    
  - On dashboard creation encountered synchronization issues with the slicers used to resolve this enabled the "Report Connections" option for each slicer from the slicer settings pane.

### 8) Key Insights 🔎
  - Total Sales of **₹1878.7K** generated from **3,500** orders, with an average rating of **3.98**.

  - High discount rate (**36%**) indicates strong reliance on price cuts to drive sales.

  - **Jeans**, **Shorts** & **T-Shirts** dominate sales, showing customer preference for casual wear.

  - Customer ratings skew positive (majority **4–5** stars), but a notable chunk of **2–3** star reviews highlights room for experience improvement.

  - Quarterly sales trend is inconsistent, reflecting seasonality & possible gaps in demand forecasting.

  - **Men** & **Women’s** categories lead while **Kids** & **Beauty** have relatively smaller contributions.
